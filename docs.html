<h4 id="concept">Philosofy and concept</h4>
Noir is a brand new interactive fiction engine.<br>
By choosing the marked words, and using <i>actions</i> on them, the player travels around the world of the game.<br>
This is the golden mean between the simplicity of menu-based interactive fiction and the freedom of parser-based interactive fiction.
<br><br>
Main principes:
<ul>
	<li>Simply, as much as possible:
		<ul>
			<li>The programming language used in Noir is so simple that it can be parsed with RegExp!</li>
			<li>The design of the engine is designed to be as minimalistic as possible.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Language neutral:
		<ul>
			<li>It doesn't matter if you are Russian, German, Japanese, or Esperantist. This engine is independent of the developer / player language.</li>
			<li>The syntax of the Noir language consists mainly of punctuation, and does not contain the keywords of English or any other language.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Extensible:
		<ul>
			<li>Despite the fact that Noir uses its own DSL (Domain Specific Language), scripts are easily extended with js-code.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
