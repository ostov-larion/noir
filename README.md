# Noir
Noir is a brand new and minimalistic Interactive Fiction engine

All interactive literature can be divided into two categories: menu-based and parse-based.
Menu-based offers a tough choice of actions.
Parser-based gives freedom to the player, allowing him to enter commands that the game interprets.
Both approaches have disadvantages: menu-based are easy to create by the author, but do not give freedom to the player; parser-based give freedom to the player, but it is usually difficult for the author to make such games.
Noir suggests otherwise.
When the game displays a description of the location, some words are underlined - these are the so-called "items". You can interact with them by clicking on them you "hold" them. Combinations of clamped items provide an opportunity for action. For example, holding a “bed” game offers you a choice of several actions: “sit down”, “lie down”, and “bed” and “ax” gives you the choice to “break”.
